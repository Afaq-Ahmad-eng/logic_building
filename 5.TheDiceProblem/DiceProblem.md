# The dice problem 

If we observe that the sum of two faces is 7 like:

1 + 6 = 7

2 + 5 = 7

and so, on 

so, the we simply minus that number from 7 

For example:

we have number 3,

so, simply do 7 - 3 = 4

and in the cubic dice 3 and 4 is oppoite of each other

Time Complexity is O(1)

Space Complexity is O(1)
