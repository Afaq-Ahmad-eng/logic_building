# Logic building - Daily Problem Solving in C++
This repository focuses on building strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills. We solve one problem daily, starting with basic mathematics and logic, and gradually progressing to more advanced concepts.

The goal is consistency, clarity, and a deep understanding of each problem, followed by solving it using an optimized approach.

## Why C++?

We have chosen C++ as the primary language for this repository because:

It is a middle‑level language (supports both low‑level and high‑level programming)

It helps in understanding memory management, data structures, and performance

Many core concepts of other languages (Java, Python, etc.) are easier to understand after learning C++

It is widely used in competitive programming, system design, and interviews

Learning C++ builds a strong foundation that transfers well to other programming languages.

## Problems Covered So Far

1. Sum of first n natural numbers

   Method: Gauss Summation Formula

2. Sum of squares of first n natural numbers

   Method: Square Pyramidal Number Formula

3. Swapping two numbers

    Method: Using Arithematic Operator or Bitwise XOR 

4. Find Closest to n and Divisible by m

    Method: sign-aware integer-division method combined with absolute-difference comparison to greedily select the nearest divisible number in constant time.

5. The Dice Problem

    Method: This solution uses pattern recognition on a cubic dice and a direct arithmetic formula (opposite = 7 - n) to find the opposite face efficiently, with a simple input validation step.

6. Nth term of Arthematic Progression from first two terms

   Method: This problem is solved using a direct mathematical formula derived from the definition of arithmetic progression, making it a constant-time, formula-based solution.

7. Leap Year

   Method: Using logical, comparison, and module operators and the formula is : ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)). And the "year" is a variable

Each problem includes:

- Clear logic

- Mathematical background (where applicable)

- Clean and readable C++ implementation

## How to Run the Code
  ### Compile
   g++ filename.cpp -o output

  ### Run
   ./output

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (GCC recommended).
