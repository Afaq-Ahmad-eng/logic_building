# Nth Term Of Arthematic Progression from firs two terms

We know the Arithmetic Progression series is like =  2, 3, 4, 5, 6. …. … 
In this series 2 is the first term and 3 is the second term of the series . 
Common difference = a2 - a1 =  3 – 2 = 1 (Difference common in the series). 
so we can write the series as :
t1 = a1 
t2 = a1 + (2-1) * d 
t3 = a1 + (3-1) * d 
. 
. 
. 
tN = a1 + (n-1) * d 

tN = a1 + (n-1) * (a2-a1) 

Time Complexity is O(1)

Space Complexity is O(1)

This Problem is also solvable using loop but then the 

Time Complexity is O(n)

SPace Complexity is O(1)
