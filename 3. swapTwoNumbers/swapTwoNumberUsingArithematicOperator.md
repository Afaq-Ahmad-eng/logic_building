# Swap two numbers using arthematic operator
For example: we have two variable a = 11 and b = 15 now we want to swap these two 
so, we can use arthematic operator 
firstly we add the both a and b and asign into the a
a = a + b, the a value is now 26
b = a - b, the value of the b is now 26 - 15 = 11
a = a - b, the value of the a is now 26 - 11 = 15
so, now the value of a = 15, and b = 11.
so, we can easily swap both number without using the third variable.
and one more thing that is we create a function and in the function we use the reference operator with the parameters so, we can swap the two numbers.

Time Complexity is O(1)
Space Complexity is O(1)
