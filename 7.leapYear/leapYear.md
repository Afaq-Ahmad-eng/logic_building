# Leap Year

The Earth takes approximately 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45 seconds to complete one orbit around the Sun, which is slightly longer than the 365 days in a common year. To account for this extra time, the Gregorian calendar (Pope Gregory XIII in 1582) adds one day every four years as a leap year. However, this introduces a small leftover error of about 11 minutes 15 seconds per year, which accumulates to 45 minutes over four years. Over a century, this error grows to 18 hours 45 minutes, so the calendar skips the leap year in years divisible by 100, leaving a small remaining difference of 5 hours 15 minutes. After 400 years, the calendar restores the leap day in years divisible by 400 (such as 1600 or 2000), reducing the error to only about 3 hours, which is tiny compared to centuries. This remaining discrepancy is not corrected immediately but gradually spreads out over time, accumulating only a few seconds per year, making the Gregorian calendar accurate for tracking the solar year and keeping seasons aligned.
