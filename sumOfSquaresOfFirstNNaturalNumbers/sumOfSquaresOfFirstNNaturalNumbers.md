# Sum of Squares of first n natral numbers
for this problem we use the Square Pyramidal Number Formula 

Formula: n(n + 1)(2n + 1) / 6

using this formula we can find any number squares of sum and this will take O(1) time complexity and for space take O(1).

The same problem we solve using loop but then this will take O(n) time and O(1) space
