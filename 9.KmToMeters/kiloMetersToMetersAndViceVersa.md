# Kilometers to meters and vice versa

We solve the problem of convertion: Kilometers to meters and vice versa 

for this we create two function's in one file:

1. float kiloMetersToMeters(float kilometers){
    return kilometers * 1000;
}

2. float metersToKiloMeters(float meters){
    return meters/1000;
}

Time Complexity is O(1)

Space Complexity is O(1)
